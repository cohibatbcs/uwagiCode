			<b>What is Uwagi?</b><br />
            <br />
			Uwagi is the most innovative and relevant 5 in 1 marketing tool for your bar.<br />
            <br />
			We provide the bar with a "Uwagi Box". The Uwagi box plays professionally recorded sound bites over the bar's house speakers.<br />
			The bar owner can customize the radio ads to reflect their upcoming specials or events.<br />
			<br />
            We provide the bar with a free Uwagi text message based Trivia.<br />
			Trivia will keep patrons in your bar longer.<br />
            <br />
            We provide the bar with tools to do research on their customers preferences.<br />
			During Trivia, Uwagi asks the patrons questions about themselves so the bar owner can understand the wants/needs of their patrons.<br />
            <br />
			We provide the bar with the ability to do mass text marketing to their customers.<br />
			This is great to letting patrons know about your specials on slow nights, or about future events.<br />
            <br />
			We provide the bar's customers with a free Uwagi smart phone application.<br />
			This is the homerun of all smart phone applications. When your bar is part of the Uwagi network, you can offer a drink special via the Uwagi app. When people launch the Uwagi App within 15 miles of your bar, they will see your drink special.<br />
            <br />
            Uwagi will help bring customers to your bar and help keep them their longer via Uwagi Trivia.
